```

## Core Types

### Term Interface
The `Term` interface represents any value in the miniKanren universe:

```go
type Term interface {
    String() string
    Equal(other Term) bool
    IsVar() bool
    Clone() Term
}
```

**Design Decisions:**
- `Clone()` method for thread-safe copying
- `IsVar()` for efficient type checking
- `Equal()` for structural equality (not unification)

### Variable (`Var`)
Logic variables with unique identifiers:

```go
type Var struct {
    id   int64
    name string
    mu   sync.RWMutex
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Globally unique IDs using atomic operations
- Optional names for debugging
- Thread-safe with RWMutex protection
- Identity-based equality

### Substitution
Mapping from variables to terms with thread-safe operations:

```go
type Substitution struct {
    bindings map[int64]Term
    mu       sync.RWMutex
}
```

**Design Decisions:**
- Immutable operations (return new substitution)
- Map keyed by variable ID for efficiency
- Walk operation follows binding chains
- Thread-safe concurrent access

### Stream
Represents sequences of substitutions using channels:

```go
type Stream struct {
    ch   chan *Substitution
    done chan struct{}
    mu   sync.Mutex
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Channel-based implementation for natural concurrency
- Non-blocking operations with context support
- Proper cleanup and resource management
- Backpressure-aware design

### Goal
Functions that transform substitutions into streams:

```go
type Goal func(ctx context.Context, sub *Substitution) *Stream
```

**Design Decisions:**
- Context parameter for cancellation/timeout
- Lazy evaluation through functions
- Composable using higher-order functions
- Clean separation of concerns

## Parallel Execution

### Worker Pool
Manages goroutines for parallel goal evaluation:

```go
type WorkerPool struct {
    maxWorkers   int
    taskChan     chan func()
    workerWg     sync.WaitGroup
    shutdownChan chan struct{}
}
```

**Features:**
- Configurable number of workers
- Graceful shutdown with WaitGroup
- Buffered task channel for backpressure
- Context-aware task submission

### Backpressure Control
Prevents memory exhaustion during large searches:

```go
type BackpressureController struct {
    maxQueueSize   int
    currentLoad    int64
    highWaterMark  int
    lowWaterMark   int
    paused         bool
    pauseChan      chan struct{}
    resumeChan     chan struct{}
}
```

**Mechanism:**
- Monitors queue size and load
- Pauses producers at high water mark
- Resumes at low water mark
- Channel-based signaling for coordination

### Rate Limiting
Controls operation frequency to prevent overwhelming:

```go
type RateLimiter struct {
    ticker   *time.Ticker
    tokens   chan struct{}
    shutdown chan struct{}
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Token bucket algorithm
- Configurable rate limits
- Graceful degradation under load
- Proper cleanup on shutdown

## Unification Algorithm

The unification algorithm is the heart of miniKanren:

```go
func unify(term1, term2 Term, sub *Substitution) *Substitution
```

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Walk both terms to their final values
2. Check for structural equality (fast path)
3. Bind variables to terms when possible
4. Recursively unify compound structures
5. Return nil on failure

**Thread Safety:**
- Pure function (no side effects)
- Creates new substitutions
- Safe for concurrent access

## Goal Composition

### Conjunction (AND)
All goals must succeed:

```go
func Conj(goals ...Goal) Goal
```

**Implementation:**
- Sequential evaluation for dependency handling
- Early termination on failure
- Proper context propagation

### Disjunction (OR)  
Any goal can succeed:

```go
func Disj(goals ...Goal) Goal
```

**Implementation:**
- Concurrent evaluation for performance
- Fair merging of results
- Context-aware cancellation

### Parallel Disjunction
Enhanced disjunction with controlled parallelism:

```go
func (pe *ParallelExecutor) ParallelDisj(goals ...Goal) Goal
```

**Features:**
- Worker pool for controlled concurrency
- Backpressure management
- Rate limiting support
- Resource cleanup

## Error Handling

### Strategy
- No exceptions - use error returns
- Context cancellation for timeouts
- Graceful degradation under load
- Proper resource cleanup

### Examples
```go
// Context timeout
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)
defer cancel()
results := RunWithContext(ctx, 100, goalFunc)

// Worker pool errors
if err := pool.Submit(ctx, task); err != nil {
    // Handle submission failure
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Minimize allocations through object reuse
- Proper garbage collection with nil-out patterns
- Bounded queues to prevent memory exhaustion
- Context-aware cancellation to stop work early

### Concurrency
- CPU-bound parallelism for goal evaluation
- I/O-bound parallelism for external operations
- Lock contention minimization
- NUMA-aware scheduling (future enhancement)

### Benchmarking
Comprehensive benchmarks for:
- Basic operations (Fresh, unification, etc.)
- Goal composition (Conj, Disj)
- Parallel vs sequential execution
- Memory usage patterns

## Hybrid Constraint System

### Architecture Overview

GoKanren implements an innovative hybrid constraint system that provides order-independent constraints while maintaining high performance. The system uses a two-tier architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 Global Constraint Bus               │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐│
│  │           Cross-Store Coordination               ││
│  │  • Global constraint registration               ││
│  │  • Inter-store constraint checking              ││
│  │  • Unification event coordination               ││
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
            │                   │                   │
    ┌───────▼─────────┐ ┌──────▼──────┐ ┌──────▼──────┐
    │LocalConstraint  │ │LocalConstraint│ │LocalConstraint│

    │ • Local bindings│ │ • Local bindings│ │ • Local bindings│
    │ • Local constraints│ │ • Local constraints│ │ • Local constraints│
    │ • Fast checking │ │ • Fast checking │ │ • Fast checking │
    └─────────────────┘ └───────────────┘ └───────────────┘
```

### Local Constraint Store

Each goal execution maintains its own `LocalConstraintStore` providing:

#### Key Components
```go
type LocalConstraintStore struct {
    id           string
    constraints  []Constraint
    bindings     map[int64]Term
    globalBus    *GlobalConstraintBus
    mu          sync.RWMutex
}
```

#### Core Functionality
- **Local Constraint Management**: Stores constraints that only affect variables in the current execution context
- **Binding Management**: Maintains variable→term mappings with automatic constraint checking
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All operations are protected by read-write mutexes for concurrent access
- **Global Bus Integration**: Coordinates with the global bus for cross-store constraints

#### Performance Characteristics
- **O(1) Binding Lookup**: Direct map access for variable resolution
- **O(n) Constraint Checking**: Linear scan of constraints during unification (n typically small)
- **Minimal Locking**: Read-heavy operations use read locks, write locks only for mutations
- **Short-Lived Objects**: Local stores are created per goal execution and garbage collected quickly

### Global Constraint Bus

The `GlobalConstraintBus` coordinates constraints that span multiple execution contexts:

#### Architecture
```go
type GlobalConstraintBus struct {
    crossStoreConstraints map[string]Constraint
    coordinators         map[string]*StoreCoordinator  
    events              chan ConstraintEvent
    mu                  sync.RWMutex
}
```

#### Coordination Mechanisms
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Constraint violations and satisfactions propagated via events
- **Store Registration**: Local stores register for relevant constraint coordination
- **Cross-Store Unification**: Ensures disequality constraints work across parallel executions
- **Minimal Synchronization**: Only coordinates when constraints actually span multiple stores

### Constraint Types

The system supports multiple constraint categories with consistent interfaces:

#### Interface Design
```go
type Constraint interface {
    ID() string
    IsLocal() bool
    Variables() []*Var
    Check(store ConstraintStore) ConstraintResult
    String() string
}

type ConstraintResult int
const (
    ConstraintSatisfied ConstraintResult = iota
    ConstraintViolated
    ConstraintPending
)
```

#### Implemented Constraints
1. **DisequalityConstraint**: Ensures two terms are not equal
2. **AbsenceConstraint**: Ensures a value doesn't appear in a structure
3. **SymbolConstraint**: Ensures a term is a string atom
4. **NumberConstraint**: Ensures a term is a numeric atom
5. **MembershipConstraint**: Handles relational membership operations

### Order Independence

The hybrid architecture enables true order independence through several mechanisms:

#### Constraint Timing
- **Immediate Checking**: When all constraint variables are bound, check immediately
- **Deferred Checking**: When variables are unbound, store constraint for later checking
- **Unification-Triggered**: All relevant constraints checked during any unification operation
- **Automatic Coordination**: System ensures all constraints are checked regardless of goal order

#### Implementation Strategy
```go
// Both patterns produce identical results:

// Pattern 1: Constraint before unification
minikanren.Conj(
    minikanren.Symbolo(q),                        // Added to constraint store
    minikanren.Eq(q, minikanren.NewAtom("test")), // Triggers constraint checking
)

// Pattern 2: Unification before constraint  
minikanren.Conj(
    minikanren.Eq(q, minikanren.NewAtom("test")), // Binding established
    minikanren.Symbolo(q),                        // Constraint checked against binding
)
```

### Parallel Constraint Handling

The system maintains constraint correctness across parallel goal execution:

#### Store Cloning
- Each parallel branch gets its own `LocalConstraintStore` copy
- Constraint state is properly isolated between parallel executions
- Global bus ensures cross-branch constraint coordination when needed

#### Synchronization Strategy
- **Local Operations**: No synchronization needed within a single store
- **Global Coordination**: Minimal locking only for cross-store constraint interactions
- **Event Propagation**: Asynchronous constraint events prevent blocking
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Hierarchical locking order prevents circular dependencies

### Performance Optimization

#### Local-First Strategy
The hybrid design optimizes for the common case where constraints are local:

- **Fast Path**: Local constraints checked without global coordination (>90% of cases)
- **Slow Path**: Global constraints require bus coordination (rare)
- **Memory Locality**: Local stores fit in CPU cache for fast constraint checking
- **Garbage Collection**: Short-lived local stores reduce GC pressure

#### Benchmarking Results
```
Local Constraint Check:     ~50ns per constraint
Global Constraint Setup:    ~500ns per constraint  
Constraint Store Creation:  ~100ns per store
Unification with Constraints: ~200ns overhead
```

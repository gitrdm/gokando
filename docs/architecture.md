# GoKanren Architecture and Design

## Overview

GoKanren is a production-quality implementation of miniKanren in Go that emphasizes thread-safety, parallel execution, and Go idioms. This document describes the architectural decisions and design principles behind the implementation.

## Core Principles

### 1. Thread Safety First
- All data structures are designed for concurrent access
- Immutable data structures where possible
- Explicit synchronization using sync package primitives
- No shared mutable state without proper protection

### 2. Parallel Execution
- Goals can be evaluated in parallel using goroutines
- Configurable worker pools for controlled concurrency
- Backpressure mechanisms to prevent resource exhaustion
- Fair scheduling and load balancing

### 3. Go Idioms
- Channels for communication between goroutines
- Context for cancellation and timeouts
- Interfaces for abstraction and testing
- Error values for explicit error handling

### 4. Production Ready
- Comprehensive test coverage including concurrent tests
- Benchmarks for performance analysis
- Proper resource management and cleanup
- Extensive documentation with examples

## Core Types

### Term Interface
The `Term` interface represents any value in the miniKanren universe:

```go
type Term interface {
    String() string
    Equal(other Term) bool
    IsVar() bool
    Clone() Term
}
```

**Design Decisions:**
- `Clone()` method for thread-safe copying
- `IsVar()` for efficient type checking
- `Equal()` for structural equality (not unification)

### Variable (`Var`)
Logic variables with unique identifiers:

```go
type Var struct {
    id   int64
    name string
    mu   sync.RWMutex
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Globally unique IDs using atomic operations
- Optional names for debugging
- Thread-safe with RWMutex protection
- Identity-based equality

### Substitution
Mapping from variables to terms with thread-safe operations:

```go
type Substitution struct {
    bindings map[int64]Term
    mu       sync.RWMutex
}
```

**Design Decisions:**
- Immutable operations (return new substitution)
- Map keyed by variable ID for efficiency
- Walk operation follows binding chains
- Thread-safe concurrent access

### Stream
Represents sequences of substitutions using channels:

```go
type Stream struct {
    ch   chan *Substitution
    done chan struct{}
    mu   sync.Mutex
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Channel-based implementation for natural concurrency
- Non-blocking operations with context support
- Proper cleanup and resource management
- Backpressure-aware design

### Goal
Functions that transform substitutions into streams:

```go
type Goal func(ctx context.Context, sub *Substitution) *Stream
```

**Design Decisions:**
- Context parameter for cancellation/timeout
- Lazy evaluation through functions
- Composable using higher-order functions
- Clean separation of concerns

## Parallel Execution

### Worker Pool
Manages goroutines for parallel goal evaluation:

```go
type WorkerPool struct {
    maxWorkers   int
    taskChan     chan func()
    workerWg     sync.WaitGroup
    shutdownChan chan struct{}
}
```

**Features:**
- Configurable number of workers
- Graceful shutdown with WaitGroup
- Buffered task channel for backpressure
- Context-aware task submission

### Backpressure Control
Prevents memory exhaustion during large searches:

```go
type BackpressureController struct {
    maxQueueSize   int
    currentLoad    int64
    highWaterMark  int
    lowWaterMark   int
    paused         bool
    pauseChan      chan struct{}
    resumeChan     chan struct{}
}
```

**Mechanism:**
- Monitors queue size and load
- Pauses producers at high water mark
- Resumes at low water mark
- Channel-based signaling for coordination

### Rate Limiting
Controls operation frequency to prevent overwhelming:

```go
type RateLimiter struct {
    ticker   *time.Ticker
    tokens   chan struct{}
    shutdown chan struct{}
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Token bucket algorithm
- Configurable rate limits
- Graceful degradation under load
- Proper cleanup on shutdown

## Unification Algorithm

The unification algorithm is the heart of miniKanren:

```go
func unify(term1, term2 Term, sub *Substitution) *Substitution
```

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Walk both terms to their final values
2. Check for structural equality (fast path)
3. Bind variables to terms when possible
4. Recursively unify compound structures
5. Return nil on failure

**Thread Safety:**
- Pure function (no side effects)
- Creates new substitutions
- Safe for concurrent access

## Goal Composition

### Conjunction (AND)
All goals must succeed:

```go
func Conj(goals ...Goal) Goal
```

**Implementation:**
- Sequential evaluation for dependency handling
- Early termination on failure
- Proper context propagation

### Disjunction (OR)  
Any goal can succeed:

```go
func Disj(goals ...Goal) Goal
```

**Implementation:**
- Concurrent evaluation for performance
- Fair merging of results
- Context-aware cancellation

### Parallel Disjunction
Enhanced disjunction with controlled parallelism:

```go
func (pe *ParallelExecutor) ParallelDisj(goals ...Goal) Goal
```

**Features:**
- Worker pool for controlled concurrency
- Backpressure management
- Rate limiting support
- Resource cleanup

## Error Handling

### Strategy
- No exceptions - use error returns
- Context cancellation for timeouts
- Graceful degradation under load
- Proper resource cleanup

### Examples
```go
// Context timeout
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)
defer cancel()
results := RunWithContext(ctx, 100, goalFunc)

// Worker pool errors
if err := pool.Submit(ctx, task); err != nil {
    // Handle submission failure
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Minimize allocations through object reuse
- Proper garbage collection with nil-out patterns
- Bounded queues to prevent memory exhaustion
- Context-aware cancellation to stop work early

### Concurrency
- CPU-bound parallelism for goal evaluation
- I/O-bound parallelism for external operations
- Lock contention minimization
- NUMA-aware scheduling (future enhancement)

### Benchmarking
Comprehensive benchmarks for:
- Basic operations (Fresh, unification, etc.)
- Goal composition (Conj, Disj)
- Parallel vs sequential execution
- Memory usage patterns

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual component testing
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Thread safety verification
- Resource cleanup validation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end goal execution
- Complex relational programs
- Parallel execution scenarios
- Performance regression tests

### Concurrent Tests

## Future Enhancements

## Conclusion

GoKanren demonstrates that functional logic programming can be efficiently implemented in Go while maintaining the language's core principles of simplicity, concurrency, and performance. The architecture balances theoretical correctness with practical concerns, resulting in a system suitable for both research and production use.

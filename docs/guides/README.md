### main

Package main solves the apartment floor puzzle using GoKando.

The puzzle: Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on different
floors of an apartment house that contains only five floors.

Constraints:
  - Baker does not live on the top floor.
  - Cooper does not live on the bottom floor.
  - Fletcher does not live on either the top or the bottom floor.
  - Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper.
  - Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher's.
  - Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper's.

Question: Where does everyone live?

Graph Coloring Problem: Color the vertices of a graph such that no two
adjacent vertices share the same color, using the minimum number of colors.

This example demonstrates:
- Pure relational constraints with Neq
- Parallel search with ParallelDisj and ParallelRun
- Performance comparison between sequential and parallel execution

The example uses a map of Australia with 7 regions and demonstrates
the classic 3-coloring problem.

### main

Package main solves the N-Queens puzzle using GoKando.

The N-Queens puzzle: Place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens
attack each other. Queens can attack any piece on the same row, column, or diagonal.

This implementation uses Project to verify the constraints efficiently for small N (4-8).
For larger boards, a more sophisticated constraint propagation approach would be needed.

### main

Package main demonstrates a parallel N-Queens solver using the FD solver
and GoKando's parallel execution framework.

This example is written in a literate, explanatory style so you can see
how the FD solver and the parallel execution framework work together.

High-level idea
  - We model the N-Queens problem with one logic variable per row that
    represents the column index (1..N).
  - Columns are constrained with an AllDifferent constraint implemented
    with Regin's filtering (the FD engine). Diagonals are modeled as
    FD-derived variables: each diagonal variable is linked to a row variable
    via an offset relation (y = x + k). The FD engine propagates those
    offset constraints so diagonals participate in AllDifferent filtering.
  - The FD propagation prunes the search aggressively before any search
    branching occurs — this greatly reduces the work that the search must do.

Parallelization strategy
  - Finding a single solution is the goal here. We parallelize across the
    choice for the first row: each worker explores the subproblem where the
    first queen is fixed to a different column. This is an easy, low-risk
    way to get parallel speedup because those branches are independent.
  - The example uses `ParallelExecutor` and `executor.ParallelDisj` to run
    branches concurrently. Once the first solution is found we cancel the
    context so remaining workers can stop early.

Why not fully automatic parallelism?
  - The library exposes helpers (ParallelDisj, ParallelMap) so callers can
    decide how to split the work. This keeps the core small and flexible —
    the example shows one idiomatic way the caller can use the executor.

Command-line flags
  - -n int (default 10): number of queens to place (upper bounded to 16)
  - -sequential: run only the sequential solver
  - -both: run sequential first, then the parallel solver

Usage examples
  - Run parallel default with 12 queens:
    go run ./examples/n-queens-parallel-fd -n 12
  - Run sequential only:
    go run ./examples/n-queens-parallel-fd -n 12 -sequential

Practical notes
  - This example demonstrates the FD+Regin combination — for larger N you
    should add symmetry breaking (e.g., canonicalize the first queen into
    half the board) or more advanced heuristics. The parallel split is a
    convenient way to use additional cores without changing the solver.

 4. If statement 5 is true, then statements 6 and 7 are both true.
 5. The 3 preceding statements are all false.
 6. Exactly 4 of the odd-numbered statements are true.
 7. Either statement 2 or 3 is true, but not both.
 8. If statement 7 is true, then 5 and 6 are both true.
 9. Exactly 3 of the first 6 statements are true.

10. The next two statements are both true.
11. Exactly 1 of statements 7, 8 and 9 are true.
12. Exactly 4 of the preceding statements are true.

Package main solves the famous Zebra puzzle (Einstein's Riddle) using GoKando.

The Zebra puzzle is a logic puzzle with the following constraints:
  - There are five houses.
  - The English man lives in the red house.
  - The Swede has a dog.
  - The Dane drinks tea.
  - The green house is immediately to the left of the white house.
  - They drink coffee in the green house.
  - The man who smokes Pall Mall has a bird.
  - In the yellow house they smoke Dunhill.
  - In the middle house they drink milk.
  - The Norwegian lives in the first house.
  - The Blend-smoker lives in the house next to the house with a cat.
  - In a house next to the house with a horse, they smoke Dunhill.
  - The man who smokes Blue Master drinks beer.
  - The German smokes Prince.
  - The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
  - They drink water in a house next to the house where they smoke Blend.

### minikanren

Package minikanren provides constraint system infrastructure for order-independent
constraint logic programming. This file defines the core interfaces and types
for managing constraints in a hybrid local/global architecture.

The constraint system uses a two-tier approach:
  - Local constraints: managed within individual goal contexts for fast checking
  - Global constraints: coordinated across contexts when constraints span multiple stores

This design provides order-independent constraint semantics while maintaining
high performance for the common case of locally-scoped constraints.

Package minikanren provides concrete implementations of constraints
for the hybrid constraint system. These constraints implement the
Constraint interface and provide the core constraint logic for
disequality, absence, type checking, and other relational operations.

Each constraint implementation follows the same pattern:
  - Efficient local checking when all variables are bound
  - Graceful handling of unbound variables (returns ConstraintPending)
  - Thread-safe operations for concurrent constraint checking
  - Proper variable dependency tracking for optimization

The constraint implementations are designed to be:
  - Fast: Optimized for the common case of local constraint checking
  - Safe: Thread-safe and defensive against malformed input
  - Debuggable: Comprehensive error messages and string representations

Package minikanren provides a thread-safe, parallel implementation of miniKanren
in Go. This implementation follows the core principles of relational programming
while leveraging Go's concurrency primitives for parallel execution.

miniKanren is a domain-specific language for constraint logic programming.
It provides a minimal set of operators for building relational programs:
  - Unification (==): Constrains two terms to be equal
  - Fresh variables: Introduces new logic variables
  - Disjunction (conde): Represents choice points
  - Conjunction: Combines goals that must all succeed
  - Run: Executes a goal and returns solutions

This implementation is designed for production use with:
  - Thread-safe operations using sync package primitives
  - Parallel goal evaluation using goroutines and channels
  - Type-safe interfaces leveraging Go's type system
  - Comprehensive error handling and resource management

Package minikanren provides the LocalConstraintStore implementation for
managing constraints and variable bindings within individual goal contexts.

The LocalConstraintStore is the core component of the hybrid constraint system,
providing fast local constraint checking while coordinating with the global
constraint bus when necessary for cross-store constraints.

Key design principles:
  - Fast path: Local constraint checking without coordination overhead
  - Slow path: Global coordination only when cross-store constraints are involved
  - Thread-safe: Safe for concurrent access and parallel goal evaluation
  - Efficient cloning: Optimized for parallel execution where stores are frequently copied

Package minikanren provides a thread-safe parallel implementation of miniKanren in Go.

Version: 1.0.0

This package offers a complete set of miniKanren operators with high-performance
concurrent execution capabilities, designed for production use.

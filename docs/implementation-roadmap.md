# GoKanDo Implementation Roadmap

## Coding and Documentation Guidelines

> These guidelines ensure consistent, high-quality implementation across all GoKanDo components. Follow these standards for all new code and documentation.

### Code Quality Standards

#### Go Language Conventions
- **Formatting**: Use `go fmt` and `goimports` for consistent formatting
- **Naming**: Follow Go naming conventions (PascalCase for exported, camelCase for unexported)
- **Error Handling**: Use structured errors with context, avoid panics for normal operation
- **Concurrency**: Prefer channels over mutexes, use `context.Context` for cancellation
- **Interfaces**: Keep interfaces small and focused, use interface composition
- **Generics**: Use Go 1.18+ generics where appropriate for type safety

#### Code Structure
- **Package Organization**: Keep packages focused and cohesive
- **Function Length**: Aim for functions under 50 lines, break down complex logic
- **Variable Scope**: Minimize variable scope, prefer local variables
- **Constants**: Use typed constants, group related constants
- **Imports**: Group standard library, third-party, and local imports separately

#### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Management**: Use sync.Pool for frequent allocations, avoid unnecessary allocations
- **Goroutines**: Limit goroutine creation, use worker pools for concurrent work
- **Channels**: Use buffered channels appropriately, handle channel closing properly
- **Benchmarking**: Include benchmarks for performance-critical code
- **Profiling**: Use pprof for performance analysis, avoid premature optimization

### Documentation Standards

#### Code Documentation
- **Package Comments**: Every package must have a doc comment explaining its purpose
- **Function Comments**: Document all exported functions with clear descriptions
- **Type Comments**: Document exported types, structs, and interfaces
- **Example Code**: Include runnable examples in doc comments where helpful
- **Usage Examples**: Show common usage patterns in documentation

#### Implementation Documentation
- **Design Decisions**: Document why architectural choices were made
- **Trade-offs**: Explain performance vs complexity trade-offs
- **Thread Safety**: Document concurrency guarantees and requirements

#### API Documentation
- **Stability**: Mark APIs as stable, experimental, or internal
- **Breaking Changes**: Document migration paths for API changes
- **Deprecation**: Use deprecation notices for APIs to be removed
- **Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning for API compatibility

### Testing Standards

#### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Aim for >90% coverage on new code
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Concurrency Tests**: Use `-race` flag to detect race conditions
- **Fuzz Tests**: Add fuzzing for input validation functions
- **Benchmark Tests**: Include benchmarks for performance-critical code

#### Test Structure
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- **Test Helpers**: Create reusable test utilities
- **Test Data**: Use realistic test data, avoid magic numbers
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error paths
- **Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup in tests, use `defer`

#### Test Naming
- **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive test names (e.g., `TestSolver_WithTimeout`)
- **Subtests**: Use `t.Run()` for related test cases
- **Parallel Tests**: Use `t.Parallel()` for independent tests
- **Benchmark Names**: Follow `Benchmark[Function][Condition]` pattern

### Implementation Approach

#### ðŸš« **ABSOLUTELY NO Technical Debt**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All implementations must be production-ready with ZERO technical debt. The following are STRICTLY ENFORCED:

- **NO Stubs**: Implement complete functionality, not placeholder functions
- **NO Placeholders**: Every code path must be fully implemented
- **NO Simplified Implementations**: All edge cases and error conditions must be handled
- **NO Fallbacks**: Do not implement "temporary" solutions that hide bugs
- **NO TODO Comments**: Resolve all issues completely before committing
- **NO "Future Work"**: Implement all required functionality now

**Consequence**: Any code containing stubs, placeholders, or simplified implementations will be rejected. Implementations must handle all specified requirements completely.

#### Development Workflow
- **Incremental Implementation**: Implement and test one component at a time
- **Interface First**: Define interfaces before implementations
- **Dependency Injection**: Use interfaces for testability and flexibility
- **Feature Flags**: Use build tags for experimental features
- **Gradual Migration**: Maintain backward compatibility during refactoring

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Structured Errors**: Use `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()` for error checking
- **Error Wrapping**: Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf()`
- **Sentinel Errors**: Define package-level sentinel errors for common cases
- **Error Types**: Create custom error types for specific error conditions
- **Logging**: Use structured logging for debugging, avoid print statements

#### Resource Management
- **Context Cancellation**: Always respect `context.Context` cancellation
- **Resource Cleanup**: Use `defer` for resource cleanup
- **Goroutine Lifecycle**: Ensure goroutines terminate properly
- **Memory Pools**: Use `sync.Pool` for expensive object reuse
- **Finalizers**: Avoid finalizers, prefer explicit cleanup

### Testing Standards

#### ðŸš« **ABSOLUTELY NO Mocks or Stubs in Testing**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Testing must use REAL implementations only. The following are STRICTLY PROHIBITED:

- **NO Mock Objects**: Test against real implementations, not mocks
- **NO Stub Functions**: Use actual code, not stubbed versions
- **NO Fake Implementations**: Test with genuine dependencies
- **NO Test Doubles**: Avoid spies, fakes, or any form of test doubles
- **NO Dependency Injection for Testing**: Do not inject fake dependencies

**Reasoning**: Mocks and stubs hide integration bugs and create false confidence. Real testing ensures the complete system works correctly.

**Alternative Approaches**:
- **Real Dependencies**: Use actual implementations in tests
- **Test Databases**: Use real databases (SQLite for unit tests)
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete component interactions
- **Hermetic Tests**: Isolate tests with real, controlled environments
- **Property-Based Testing**: Test actual behavior, not mocked expectations

#### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Aim for >90% coverage on new code
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Concurrency Tests**: Use `-race` flag to detect race conditions
- **Fuzz Tests**: Add fuzzing for input validation functions
- **Benchmark Tests**: Include benchmarks for performance-critical code

#### Test Structure
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- **Test Helpers**: Create reusable test utilities
- **Test Data**: Use realistic test data, avoid magic numbers
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error paths
- **Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup in tests, use `defer`

#### Test Naming
- **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive test names (e.g., `TestSolver_WithTimeout`)
- **Subtests**: Use `t.Run()` for related test cases
- **Parallel Tests**: Use `t.Parallel()` for independent tests
- **Benchmark Names**: Follow `Benchmark[Function][Condition]` pattern

- Unit tests for all components with high coverage (>90%) in `*_test.go` files
- Integration tests for component interaction in `integration_test.go`
- Performance regression tests with benchmark comparisons
- Concurrency and race condition tests with `-race` flag
- Memory leak detection tests with profiling
- Fuzz testing for input validation in `*_fuzz_test.go`
- Cross-platform compatibility tests in CI pipeline

### Code Quality Standards

**Requirements**:
- Static analysis passes all checks with `golangci-lint`
- Code follows Go best practices with `go fmt` and `go vet`
- Comprehensive error handling with structured errors
- Proper resource management with defer statements
- Clear code documentation with package comments
- Consistent naming conventions following Go style
- Security vulnerability scanning with automated tools

### Release Process

**Requirements**:
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Performance benchmarking in releases with regression detection
- API compatibility checking with automated migration guides
- Documentation generation and publishing with CI
- Security scanning and dependency updates with Dependabot
- Release notes and migration guides generated automatically

This roadmap provides a complete, production-ready implementation plan with specific file locations and line number references to help locate relevant code sections for each task.

Graph Coloring Problem: Color the vertices of a graph such that no two
adjacent vertices share the same color, using the minimum number of colors.

This example demonstrates:
- Pure relational constraints with Neq
- Parallel search with ParallelDisj and ParallelRun
- Performance comparison between sequential and parallel execution

The example uses a map of Australia with 7 regions and demonstrates
the classic 3-coloring problem.

Package main solves the N-Queens puzzle using GoKando.

The N-Queens puzzle: Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens
attack each other. Queens can attack any piece on the same row, column, or diagonal.

This implementation uses Project to verify the constraints efficiently for small N (4-8).
For larger boards, a more sophisticated constraint propagation approach would be needed.

10. The next two statements are both true.
11. Exactly 1 of statements 7, 8 and 9 are true.
12. Exactly 4 of the preceding statements are true.

Package main solves the famous Zebra puzzle (Einstein's Riddle) using GoKando.

The Zebra puzzle is a logic puzzle with the following constraints:
  - There are five houses.
  - The English man lives in the red house.
  - The Swede has a dog.
  - The Dane drinks tea.
  - The green house is immediately to the left of the white house.
  - They drink coffee in the green house.
  - The man who smokes Pall Mall has a bird.
  - In the yellow house they smoke Dunhill.
  - In the middle house they drink milk.
  - The Norwegian lives in the first house.
  - The Blend-smoker lives in the house next to the house with a cat.
  - In a house next to the house with a horse, they smoke Dunhill.
  - The man who smokes Blue Master drinks beer.

### [minikanren](minikanren.md)

Package minikanren provides constraint system infrastructure for order-independent
constraint logic programming. This file defines the core interfaces and types
for managing constraints in a hybrid local/global architecture.

The constraint system uses a two-tier approach:
  - Local constraints: managed within individual goal contexts for fast checking
  - Global constraints: coordinated across contexts when constraints span multiple stores

This design provides order-independent constraint semantics while maintaining
high performance for the common case of locally-scoped constraints.

Package minikanren provides concrete implementations of constraints
for the hybrid constraint system. These constraints implement the
Constraint interface and provide the core constraint logic for
disequality, absence, type checking, and other relational operations.

Each constraint implementation follows the same pattern:
  - Efficient local checking when all variables are bound
  - Graceful handling of unbound variables (returns ConstraintPending)
  - Thread-safe operations for concurrent constraint checking
  - Proper variable dependency tracking for optimization

The constraint implementations are designed to be:
  - Fast: Optimized for the common case of local constraint checking
  - Safe: Thread-safe and defensive against malformed input
  - Debuggable: Comprehensive error messages and string representations

Package minikanren provides a thread-safe, parallel implementation of miniKanren
in Go. This implementation follows the core principles of relational programming
while leveraging Go's concurrency primitives for parallel execution.

miniKanren is a domain-specific language for constraint logic programming.
It provides a minimal set of operators for building relational programs:
  - Unification (==): Constrains two terms to be equal
  - Fresh variables: Introduces new logic variables
  - Disjunction (conde): Represents choice points
  - Conjunction: Combines goals that must all succeed
  - Run: Executes a goal and returns solutions

This implementation is designed for production use with:
  - Thread-safe operations using sync package primitives
  - Parallel goal evaluation using goroutines and channels
  - Type-safe interfaces leveraging Go's type system
  - Comprehensive error handling and resource management

Package minikanren provides the LocalConstraintStore implementation for
managing constraints and variable bindings within individual goal contexts.

The LocalConstraintStore is the core component of the hybrid constraint system,
providing fast local constraint checking while coordinating with the global
constraint bus when necessary for cross-store constraints.

Key design principles:
  - Fast path: Local constraint checking without coordination overhead
  - Slow path: Global coordination only when cross-store constraints are involved
  - Thread-safe: Safe for concurrent access and parallel goal evaluation
  - Efficient cloning: Optimized for parallel execution where stores are frequently copied

Package minikanren provides a thread-safe parallel implementation of miniKanren in Go.

Version: 0.11.0

This package offers a complete set of miniKanren operators with high-performance
concurrent execution capabilities, designed for production use.

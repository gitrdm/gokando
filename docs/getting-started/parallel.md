# Getting Started with parallel

Package parallel provides advanced parallel execution capabilities
for miniKanren goals. This package contains internal utilities
for managing concurrent goal evaluation with proper resource
management and backpressure control.


## Overview

**Import Path:** `github.com/gitrdm/gokando/internal/parallel`

Package parallel provides advanced parallel execution capabilities
for miniKanren goals. This package contains internal utilities
for managing concurrent goal evaluation with proper resource
management and backpressure control.


## Installation

### Install the package

```bash
go get github.com/gitrdm/gokando/internal/parallel
```

### Verify installation

Create a simple test file to verify the package works:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/gitrdm/gokando/internal/parallel"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("parallel package imported successfully!")
}
```

Run it:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Quick Start

Here's a basic example to get you started with parallel:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/gitrdm/gokando/internal/parallel"
)

func main() {
    // TODO: Add basic usage example
    fmt.Println("Hello from parallel!")
}
```

## Key Features

### Types

- **BackpressureController** - BackpressureController manages backpressure in the goal evaluation pipeline to prevent memory exhaustion during large or infinite search spaces.

- **LoadBalancer** - LoadBalancer distributes work across multiple workers using a round-robin strategy to ensure fair distribution.

- **RateLimiter** - RateLimiter provides rate limiting functionality to prevent overwhelming downstream consumers during intensive goal evaluation.

- **StreamMerger** - StreamMerger combines multiple streams into a single output stream while maintaining fairness and preventing any single stream from dominating the output.

- **Worker** - Worker represents a worker that can process tasks.

- **WorkerPool** - WorkerPool manages a pool of goroutines for parallel goal evaluation. It provides controlled concurrency with backpressure handling to prevent resource exhaustion during large search spaces.

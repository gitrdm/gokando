# GoKanDo Implementation Roadmap

## Coding and Documentation Guidelines

> These guidelines ensure consistent, high-quality implementation across all GoKanDo components. Follow these standards for all new code and documentation.

### Code Quality Standards

#### Go Language Conventions
- **Formatting**: Use `go fmt` and `goimports` for consistent formatting
- **Naming**: Follow Go naming conventions (PascalCase for exported, camelCase for unexported)
- **Error Handling**: Use structured errors with context, avoid panics for normal operation
- **Concurrency Abstractions**:
  - Use goroutines for lightweight parallelism
  - Use channels for safe communication and synchronization between goroutines
  - Use `sync.Mutex`/`sync.RWMutex` for protecting shared mutable state
  - Use `sync.WaitGroup` for coordinating goroutine lifecycles
  - Use `sync.Once` for one-time initialization
  - Use `sync.Pool` for efficient object reuse in concurrent scenarios
  - Use `context.Context` for cancellation, deadlines, and value propagation
  - Prefer message passing and encapsulation over shared mutable state
- **Interfaces**: Keep interfaces small and focused, use interface composition
- **Generics**: Use Go 1.18+ generics where appropriate for type safety

#### Code Structure
- **Package Organization**: Keep packages focused and cohesive
- **Function Length**: Aim for functions under 50 lines, break down complex logic
- **Variable Scope**: Minimize variable scope, prefer local variables
- **Constants**: Use typed constants, group related constants
- **Imports**: Group standard library, third-party, and local imports separately

#### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Management**: Use sync.Pool for frequent allocations, avoid unnecessary allocations
- **Goroutines**: Limit goroutine creation, use worker pools for concurrent work
- **Channels**: Use buffered channels appropriately, handle channel closing properly
- **Worker Pools**: Use worker pool patterns to manage concurrency and resource usage
- **Atomic Operations**: Use `sync/atomic` for lock-free updates where appropriate
- **Immutable Data Structures**: Prefer immutable data for safe sharing between goroutines
- **Benchmarking**: Include benchmarks for performance-critical code
- **Profiling**: Use pprof for performance analysis, avoid premature optimization

### Documentation Standards

#### Code Documentation
- **Package Comments**: Every package must have a doc comment explaining its purpose
- **Function Comments**: Document all exported functions with clear literate style descriptions
- **Type Comments**: Document exported types, structs, and interfaces
- **Example Code**: Do NOT Include code in doc comments, instead use a Go Example
- **Usage Examples**: Show common usage patterns in documentation as narrative that points to actual code as needed.

#### Implementation Documentation
- **Design Decisions**: Document why architectural choices were made
- **Trade-offs**: Explain performance vs complexity trade-offs
- **Thread Safety and Concurrency**:
  - Document which abstractions (goroutines, channels, mutexes, worker pools, context) are used for thread safety and parallelism
  - Clearly state invariants and guarantees for concurrent access
  - Note any patterns for error propagation and resource cleanup in concurrent code

#### API Documentation
- **Stability**: Mark APIs as stable, experimental, or internal
- **Breaking Changes**: Document migration paths for API changes
- **Deprecation**: Use deprecation notices for APIs to be removed
- **Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning for API compatibility

### Testing Standards

#### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Aim for >90% coverage on new code
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Concurrency Tests**: Use `-race` flag to detect race conditions
- **Fuzz Tests**: Add fuzzing for input validation functions
- **Benchmark Tests**: Include benchmarks for performance-critical code

#### Test Structure
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- **Test Helpers**: Create reusable test utilities
- **Test Data**: Use realistic test data, avoid magic numbers
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error paths
- **Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup in tests, use `defer`

- **Subtests**: Use `t.Run()` for related test cases
- **Parallel Tests**: Use `t.Parallel()` for independent tests
- **Benchmark Names**: Follow `Benchmark[Function][Condition]` pattern

### Implementation Approach
#### Concurrency and Parallelism Principles
- Use Go's goroutines and channels as the primary concurrency model (CSP style)
- Use worker pools and message passing for scalable parallel execution
- Protect shared state with mutexes or encapsulate state within goroutines
- Use context for cancellation and deadlines across concurrent operations
- Prefer immutable data structures for safe sharing
- Always test with `-race` to detect race conditions

#### 🚫 **ABSOLUTELY NO Technical Debt**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All implementations must be production-ready with ZERO technical debt. The following are STRICTLY ENFORCED:

- **NO Stubs**: Implement complete functionality, not placeholder functions
- **NO Placeholders**: Every code path must be fully implemented
- **NO Simplified Implementations**: All edge cases and error conditions must be handled
- **NO Fallbacks**: Do not implement "temporary" solutions that hide bugs
- **NO TODO Comments**: Resolve all issues completely before committing
- **NO "Future Work"**: Implement all required functionality now

**Consequence**: Any code containing stubs, placeholders, or simplified implementations will be rejected. Implementations must handle all specified requirements completely.

#### Development Workflow
- **Incremental Implementation**: Implement and test one component at a time
- **Interface First**: Define interfaces before implementations
- **Dependency Injection**: Use interfaces for testability and flexibility
- **Feature Flags**: Use build tags for experimental features
- **Gradual Migration**: Maintain backward compatibility during refactoring

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Structured Errors**: Use `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()` for error checking
- **Error Wrapping**: Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf()`
- **Sentinel Errors**: Define package-level sentinel errors for common cases
- **Error Types**: Create custom error types for specific error conditions
- **Logging**: Use structured logging for debugging, avoid print statements

#### Resource Management
- **Context Cancellation**: Always respect `context.Context` cancellation
- **Resource Cleanup**: Use `defer` for resource cleanup
- **Goroutine Lifecycle**: Ensure goroutines terminate properly; use WaitGroups for coordination
- **Memory Pools**: Use `sync.Pool` for expensive object reuse
- **Finalizers**: Avoid finalizers, prefer explicit cleanup

### Testing Standards

#### 🚫 **ABSOLUTELY NO Mocks or Stubs in Testing**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Testing must use REAL implementations only. The following are STRICTLY PROHIBITED:

- **NO Mock Objects**: Test against real implementations, not mocks
- **NO Stub Functions**: Use actual code, not stubbed versions
- **NO Fake Implementations**: Test with genuine dependencies
- **NO Test Doubles**: Avoid spies, fakes, or any form of test doubles
- **NO Dependency Injection for Testing**: Do not inject fake dependencies

**Reasoning**: Mocks and stubs hide integration bugs and create false confidence. Real testing ensures the complete system works correctly.

**Alternative Approaches**:
- **Real Dependencies**: Use actual implementations in tests
- **Test Databases**: Use real databases (SQLite for unit tests)
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete component interactions
- **Hermetic Tests**: Isolate tests with real, controlled environments
- **Property-Based Testing**: Test actual behavior, not mocked expectations

#### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Aim for >90% coverage on new code
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Concurrency Tests**: Use `-race` flag to detect race conditions; test parallel execution and thread safety
- **Fuzz Tests**: Add fuzzing for input validation functions
- **Benchmark Tests**: Include benchmarks for performance-critical code

#### Test Structure
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- **Test Helpers**: Create reusable test utilities
- **Test Data**: Use realistic test data, avoid magic numbers
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error paths
- **Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup in tests, use `defer`

#### Test Naming
- **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive test names (e.g., `TestSolver_WithTimeout`)
- **Subtests**: Use `t.Run()` for related test cases
- **Parallel Tests**: Use `t.Parallel()` for independent tests
- **Benchmark Names**: Follow `Benchmark[Function][Condition]` pattern

### Documentation Generation

#### Living Documentation and Go Example Functions
- **Go Example Functions**: Use `ExampleXxx()` functions in test files. These are executed as part of the test suite and automatically included in GoDoc, ensuring examples are always up-to-date and correct.
- **Narrative Guides**: Write documentation that describes usage patterns and links to real, tested code (e.g., in `examples/` or `cookbook/` folders) rather than embedding static code snippets in markdown.
- **Reference, Don't Copy**: Link to tested example programs and functions instead of copying code into markdown files. Avoid static code snippets that can become outdated.
- **Automated Doc Generation**: Use tools that extract documentation from actual code and tests, not from static markdown.
- **Continuous Integration**: Ensure all example code is run in CI to prevent drift and keep documentation synchronized with the codebase.
- **Design Rationale**: Explain why design decisions were made in guides and comments.
- **Troubleshooting**: Include debugging and troubleshooting guides that reference tested code.
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Use ASCII diagrams for architecture documentation.

#### API Documentation
